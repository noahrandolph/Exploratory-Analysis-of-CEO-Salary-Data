# Exploratory-Analysis-of-CEO-Salary-Data

An exploratory analysis of CEO and company data was conducted to explore CEO salary, with a particular interest in answering the question of whether company performance is related to CEO salary.
Exploratory data analysis techniques were used and will be presented with commentary on the findings. We first explore data in univariate fashion, followed by multivariate analyses selected for their contribution to the exploration of CEO salary. In general, CEO salary is treated as a response variable, while other datasets are treated as predictor variables.
